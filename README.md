# Biometric-Attendance-system-with-Automatic-Voice-Messages-Using-Arduino
In this project we implement a biometric attendance system that scans for fingerprints to record and store attendance data with the date and time of entry. It is also used as a security system that allows access to authorized people only. To improve the quality of life of the user, custom automated voice messages are used to welcome or guide the user through the process. We use the fingerprint module to scan or input the fingerprint templates of the user. After storing their fingerprint, the users can now use it to gain access into their place of work where the system will record the date and time of entry of the person. Along with this, a speaker is used to give voice messages. Audio encoding software such as audacity is used to convert AI based MP3 audio file to convert into 16-bit PCM. This can be utilized with help of PCM library on Arduino IDE. With the use of 4 buttons; ENROLL, OK/DEL, UP and DOWN users can navigate their way around this simple but cost- effective system. Administrator can view, delete the attendance log at any point of time. With a EEPROM of 1 KB, we can store 7 bytes of date and time data for 4 different users up to 30 entries at any given time. With increased memory, higher number of people can be enrolled.
